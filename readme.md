Hovis Home IOT
==============

This is designed as an rpi-compatible Node-red + MQTT Docker Compose setup that does not rely on its own docker images.

Lord knows how long this will last without maintenance.

It's important that the user on your pi have gid 1000 and uid 1000 for file permissions in the containers to work.  The default pi user is sufficient, but not terribly secure.
